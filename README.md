Add Logo to Photo
========================

Thank you for downloading my PHP project.

This document contains information on what it is, install, and
use my small project. 


1) What is Add Logo to Photo
----------------------------------

There are many situations when a photo uploader needs to have some branding, rights, and many other things.
Add logo to photo lets you choose from your logo and allow users who upload photos having a preferred logo image
stamped. These can apply to profile photos, landscapes, news, etc.
The default code example fully functional once you have installed it, it is for a Profile photo 207x207px with a Logo 65x50px.
You can simply modify this by going to the Constants, and change accordingly the CSS and the disposition of the grid.


2) Requirements
----------------------------------

Easy! You will only need to have installed the following:

- Apache or any other server running PHP

- PHP 5.0 or later. 

- Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera.

3) Installation
-------------------------------------

Copy all the files under your root folder for apache projects. 
Launch your Apache. 
Open your browser on (I.E.):

3) How to use it
